BHumanCodeRelease
=================

The official 2015 B-Human code release. 

Since some teams reported serious problems with the code release on NAOqi 2.1.4 resulting in robots being unusable, we currently cannot recommend using it. However, we have not been able to reproduce any of these problems on our robots.

The 2014 code release is tagged with "coderelease2014".

The 2013 code release is tagged with "coderelease2013".
