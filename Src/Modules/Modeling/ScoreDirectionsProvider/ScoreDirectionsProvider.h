/**
 * @file ScoreDirectionsProvider.h
 * The file declares a module that determines sectors of directions in which the ball can be
 * kicked and hit the goal. This is based on the obstacle model. The problem is solved using
 * a sweep line method. All obstacles are described as angular sectors surrounding the ball.
 * The two edges of each sector, i.e. the direction in which an obstacle begins and the
 * direction in which it ends, are added to an array that is then sorted by the angles. The
 * goal posts are added as well. After that, the array is traversed while updating an
 * obstacle counter. Whenever a starting edge is encountered, the counter is increased, and
 * when an ending edge is found, the counter is lowered. Whenever the counter is zero, a
 * free sector was found.
